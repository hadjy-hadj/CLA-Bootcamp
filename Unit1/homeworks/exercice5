#1-Write a Python class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width and a method which will compute the area of a rectangle.
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(rec,length,width):
        rec.length=length
        rec.width=width
    def area(area):
        return (area.length*area.width)/2
ABC=Rectangle(4,3)
print(ABC.area())
#2-Create a Vehicle class with max_speed and mileage instance attributes
class Vehicle:
    def max_speed():
        pass
    def mileage():
        pass

#3-Create a Vehicle class without any variables and methods.
class Vehicle:
    pass

#4-Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class
class Bus(Vehicle):
    def max_speed():
        super().max_speed()
        pass
    def mileage():
        super().mileage()
        pass
